# Raj's New Year Puzzles
At the end of every year, I hand craft a set of mathematical puzzles for my friends. These puzzles involve the new year number, and is a fun way to start the year!

Usually these puzzles deal with number theory, combinatorics, some algebra, and occassionally some calculus and geometry. 

Some require a little bit of programming, or scouring the internet for answers :)
